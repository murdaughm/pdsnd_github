Bikeshare.py

### Contributors
Template of program written by Udacity.  
The rest was written by Mike Murdaugh with help from sources cited below.

### Program Purpose and Scope:
This program is a project submittal for Udacity's "Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program".
The purpose of this program is to allow the user to filter and examine data from bikeshare programs in different cities.  
The bikeshare program allowed users to borrow bicycles and ride them from one station to the next.
Data was collected for each trip taken and includes:

- Trip Start Time, End Time and Duration (time)
- Start Station and End Station (location)
- User's Gender
- User's Birth Year

Statistics for the above data are calculated and displayed by the program using user input to filter the data.
